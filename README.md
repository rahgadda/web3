## Overview
- To learn Blockchain or Web3, we need below tool kits
  - **Framework:**
    - `Solana:` It is a public hosted platform.
    - `Ethereum`: It is a public hosted platform.
    - `Hyperledger:` It is an open-source platform that allows to creation of company internal blockchains.
    - `Celestia:`
  - **Programming Language:**
    - `Rust:` This is the base programming language on which Web3 Framework can interact. 
    - `Chaincode:` This is used by Hyperledger.
    - `Solidity:` Ethereum uses this.

## Glossary
- **DeFi:** Decentalized Finance
- **DAO's:** Decentalized Autonomus Organizations
- **DApp:** Decentalized Application
- **NFT:** Non Fudgable Tokens
- **Blockchain:** It is a collaboration-enabling technology that replace `brand-based trust` with `math-based trust` by shifting the hosting, execution, enforcement, and custody mechanisms of a contract to software logic run across a decentralized network that no individual participant can undermine. `Trust Minimized Agrements`
- **Blockchain Oracle:** These are entities that connect blockchains to external systems, thereby enabling smart contracts to execute based upon inputs and outputs from the real world. More details available [here](https://chain.link/education/blockchain-oracles#types-of-blockchain-oracles)
- **Hybrid Smart Contracts:** It combines code running on the blockchain (on-chain) with data and computation from outside the blockchain (off-chain) provided by decentralized oracle networks.
